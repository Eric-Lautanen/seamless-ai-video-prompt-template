SEAMLESS AI VIDEO PROMPT GENERATOR
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INSTRUCTIONS: You are an AI video director creating seamless, single-take-style sequences. Break down concepts into 6-second clips where ALL elements (camera, subject, lighting, motion blur) continue fluidly from clip to clip. Each clip's END state becomes the next clip's START state - VERBATIM.

CONTENT TYPE(S): Product

VIDEO DURATION: 24 seconds

CLIP LENGTH: 6 seconds

SUBJECT/CONCEPT: Luxury Swiss chronograph watch commercial featuring a rotating display on black velvet pedestal against gradient background. Watch features exposed movement, blue hands, and leather strap. Camera orbits 360° around the watch with dramatic lighting revealing intricate mechanical details. Final shot focuses on brand logo on dial.

STYLE GUIDELINES: Photorealistic, ultra high-end product photography, dramatic contrast, jewel-tone reflections, cinematic luxury aesthetic

ASPECT RATIO: 16:9

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: Emphasize reflections on sapphire crystal, highlight mechanical movement through exhibition caseback, ensure smooth orbital movement, final logo reveal should be crisp and centered

NEGATIVE PROMPTS: fingerprints, dust, scratches, unwanted reflections, motion blur on product, text overlays, watermark, low resolution, compression artifacts, unnatural lighting, overexposure, chromatic aberration

KEY RULES:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. **Calculate clips:** Total Duration ÷ 6 = Number of clips needed
2. **Design ONE continuous camera move** for entire sequence, then break into clip segments
3. **CRITICAL CONTINUITY:** Clip N's END FRAME = Clip N+1's START FRAME (copy verbatim, word-for-word)
4. **Smooth transitions:** When changing movement types, blend them (e.g., "Continue dolly 2 sec, add pan while maintaining dolly 2 sec, end dolly as pan continues final 2 sec")
5. **Use exact measurements:** Not "~15%" but "15%", not "about 3 feet" but "3 feet", include units (ft/sec, degrees/sec)
6. **Fill ALL fields** for every clip - even if "maintaining previous state"
7. **Motion blur scale:** 0-5% minimal, 5-15% subtle, 15-25% moderate, 25-40% strong, 40%+ extreme

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT FORMAT (USE FOR EACH CLIP):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**IMPORTANT:** If your platform supports it, output each clip in a separate container/artifact/canvas for easy copying:
- Claude: Use separate Artifacts
- ChatGPT: Use Canvas or code blocks
- Other platforms: Use clear separators between clips

**Clip X of Y:**

**START FRAME (Clip 2+ only):** [EXACT copy of previous clip's END FRAME - verbatim, no shortcuts]

**Narrative:** [What happens in this 6-second segment]

**Camera Movement:**
- START: [Exact position - e.g., "4 feet behind subject, 3 feet elevated, centered"]

- END POSITION: [Exact final position]
- END MOTION STATE: [Active movement continuing]

**Subject Framing:**
- START: [Position in frame - e.g., "Subject centered at 50% horizontal, 60% frame height"]

**Background/Environment:**

CAMERA MOVEMENT QUICK REF:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**LINEAR:** Dolly (forward/back), Truck (left/right), Crane/Pedestal (up/down)
**ROTATIONAL:** Pan (horizontal spin), Tilt (vertical spin), Roll/Dutch (horizon tilt)
**COMPLEX:** Arc (circular around subject), Orbital (360° circle), Zoom (focal length change)
**SPEEDS:** Glacial 0.1-0.3 ft/sec, Slow 0.5-1, Moderate 1.5-3, Fast 4-6, Rapid 7+ ft/sec

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUICK NEGATIVE PROMPTS (Optional - Apply at Generation Stage):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Universal:** flicker, blur, morphing, text, watermark, low quality
**Humans:** extra fingers, deformed hands, warped face, bad anatomy, extra limbs
**Product:** fingerprints, dust, scratches, reflections, text
**Action:** jitter, stutter, unnatural physics, shaky camera
**VFX:** unconvincing compositing, temporal inconsistency, flat lighting

**How to use:**
- Platforms with negative field (Runway, Pika, Kling): Paste negatives in dedicated field
- Platforms without (Sora, Luma, Veo): Add to end of prompt: "Avoid: [negatives]"
- Use SAME negatives for ALL clips in sequence for consistency

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PRO WORKFLOW WITH LAST FRAME METHOD:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Generate Clip 1 as TEXT-TO-VIDEO
2. EXPORT last frame from video editor (NOT screenshot - must be native resolution/aspect ratio)
3. Generate Clip 2 as IMAGE-TO-VIDEO (use exported frame + Clip 2 prompt)
4. EXPORT last frame of Clip 2
5. Generate Clip 3 as IMAGE-TO-VIDEO (use Clip 2's last frame + Clip 3 prompt)
6. Repeat for all clips
7. Stitch together in editor

This creates pixel-perfect continuity between clips.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONTINUITY CHECKLIST (Verify Each Transition):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Between Clip N and Clip N+1, verify:
☐ Camera position matches exactly (with exact measurements)
☐ Camera movement transitions smoothly (blend movements, don't jump)
☐ Subject framing/position matches (with exact percentages)
☐ Background elements tracked
☐ Lighting state matches
☐ Focus/DOF noted (even if "maintaining")
☐ Motion blur direction/intensity matches
☐ END FRAME of Clip N = START FRAME of Clip N+1 (exact match)

END OF TEMPLATE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Remember:** This template ensures seamless continuity. When generating actual video:
- Use negative prompts consistently across all clips
- Export last frames from editor (not screenshots) at native resolution
- Use image-to-video for Clips 2+ with exported frames
- Stitch final sequence in editor

Good luck creating cinematic AI videos!
