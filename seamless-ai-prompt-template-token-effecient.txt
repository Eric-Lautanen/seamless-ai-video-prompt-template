# SEAMLESS AI VIDEO PROMPT GENERATOR — LITE

QUICK INPUT

CONTENT TYPE:
[Genre, style, narrative intent + camera perspective (e.g., Male POV Cyberpunk / Stylized realism)]

DURATION:
[Total seconds]

CLIP LENGTH:
[Seconds per clip]

AUDIO:
[Music / Ambient / Foley / Dialogue levels or None]

CONTINUITY MODE:
[CONTINUOUS / STRICT / EVOLVING]

DURATION EXTENSION (OPTIONAL)

If scene cannot fit:
- Extend BEFORE generation
- Minimum required
- Whole seconds
- ≤30%
- Lock once declared

If not required → use original duration exactly.

EXECUTION

Upload → Prefill only
Say "run" → Generate all clips

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

- Generate EXACTLY one artifact per clip.
- Each artifact must contain EXACTLY one fenced code block.
- The code block must contain the complete prompt for that clip.
- Do not combine clips in one artifact.
- Do not output prompts directly in chat.
- Filename format: clip_[number]_of_[total].txt
- Each prompt must be copyable in one action.
- If any clip is not isolated in its own artifact, output is invalid.

Each generated clip prompt MUST begin with:

- Style (short form, e.g., Cyberpunk / Stylized realism)
- Camera perspective (e.g., Male POV, Female POV, Third-person)
- Aspect ratio (if declared)
- Audio state (even if None)
- Continuity mode

These must remain identical across all clips unless EVOLVING mode visibly changes them.

CORE STRUCTURE

- Duration ÷ Clip Length = total clips
- Same seed for all clips
- Clip 2+ START FRAME = previous END FRAME
- Continuity enforced at clip boundaries
- No implicit resets or rebuilds
- Style and camera perspective persist across all clips

CLIP DETAIL DISTRIBUTION (TOKEN EFFICIENT)

Clip 1:
- Most detailed
- Fully defines environment
- Fully defines subject appearance
- Establishes baseline lighting
- Establishes camera perspective
- Establishes audio state
- Establishes object layout
- Establishes tone and atmosphere

Clips 2+:
- Use short-form style reference (e.g., Cyberpunk / Stylized realism)
- Maintain same camera perspective wording
- Maintain same audio declaration
- Brief action description only
- Include dialogue only if present
- Do NOT restate full environment unless changed
- Do NOT restate full character description unless altered visibly
- Must still describe END FRAME clearly

DIALOGUE PERFORMANCE LAYER (TOKEN EFFICIENT)

Applies only when dialogue exists in a clip.

When dialogue is present:

- Specify emotion
- Specify tone of voice
- Specify vocal intensity
- Specify delivery style (whispered, strained, breathless, controlled, cold, trembling, clipped, etc.)
- Keep descriptors concise (2–6 words per attribute max)
- Do not over-describe unless emotion shifts mid-line

Format:

Character Name (emotion, tone, intensity, delivery):
"Dialogue line"

If emotion shifts mid-line:

Character Name (emotion → emotion shift, tone consistent):
"Dialogue line"

If multiple characters speak:
Apply performance tags to each speaker individually.

If no dialogue:
Do not include this layer.

VISIBILITY LOCK (BOUNDARY-BASED)

Anything required in the next clip
must be visible in the current END FRAME.

Elements may temporarily leave frame
or become occluded mid-clip
if natural to motion or blocking.

However:

If needed in future clips,
they must be visible again by END FRAME.

No element may appear from non-existence
at the start of a new clip.

PERSISTENCE RULE (LITE — FLEXIBLE)

All elements visible in Clip 1 establish baseline state.

Any element introduced must:
- Remain part of the scene
- Remain visually consistent
- Exist across the sequence
until no longer needed

Temporary occlusion or frame exit is allowed
if caused by natural movement.

Permanent removal must be shown on-screen.

No silent disappearance.
No silent substitution.
No unexplained design change.
No wearable altering appearance.
No camera perspective shift unless declared.
No audio state reset unless declared.

NATURALISM PRIORITY

Continuity must not override realistic human behavior.

- Arms swing naturally when walking.
- Weight shifts follow human biomechanics.
- Blocking follows believable cinematic logic.
- No rigid posing to preserve visibility.
- No mechanical staging for rule compliance.

Natural motion is preferred.
Continuity is enforced at clip boundaries.

MODE RULES

CONTINUOUS:
Environment, style, audio state, and camera perspective locked.

STRICT:
Everything in CONTINUOUS plus:
- No lighting drift
- No color grade shift
- No focal length change
- No object repositioning unless animated
- No aesthetic reinterpretation

EVOLVING:
Gradual, causally justified progression allowed.
Changes must be visible before completion.
No teleportation.
No abrupt scene rewrite.
Style and camera perspective remain unless explicitly evolved on-screen.

TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY

- Motion continues smoothly
- No position jumps without cut
- Facing direction preserved unless intentional
- Actions complete realistically
- Background motion maintains momentum
- Audio state persists unless visibly changed

DURATION RESOLUTION

Original:
[XX]

Extension:
[None] OR [+X]

Final Locked:
[XX]

Total Clips:
[X]

FINAL FRAME REQUIREMENT

Each clip must end with a fully described END FRAME.

That END FRAME becomes the next START FRAME.

All elements required for future actions
must be visible in that END FRAME.

Style, camera perspective, and audio state
must remain consistent into the next clip.
