# SEAMLESS AI VIDEO PROMPT GENERATOR — LITE

QUICK INPUT

CONTENT TYPE:
[Genre, style, narrative intent]

DURATION:
[Total seconds]

CLIP LENGTH:
[Seconds per clip]

CONTINUITY MODE:
[CONTINUOUS / STRICT / EVOLVING]

DURATION EXTENSION (OPTIONAL)

If scene cannot fit:
- Extend BEFORE generation
- Minimum required
- Whole seconds
- ≤30%
- Lock once declared

If not required → use original duration exactly.

EXECUTION

Upload → Prefill only
Say "run" → Generate all clips

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

- Generate EXACTLY one artifact per clip.
- Each artifact must contain EXACTLY one fenced code block.
- The code block must contain the complete prompt for that clip.
- Do not combine clips in one artifact.
- Do not output prompts directly in chat.
- Filename format: clip_[number]_of_[total].txt
- Each prompt must be copyable in one action.
- If any clip is not isolated in its own artifact, output is invalid.

CORE STRUCTURE

- Duration ÷ Clip Length = total clips
- Same seed for all clips
- Clip 2+ START FRAME = previous END FRAME
- Continuity enforced at clip boundaries
- No implicit resets or rebuilds

VISIBILITY LOCK (BOUNDARY-BASED)

Anything required in the next clip
must be visible in the current END FRAME.

Elements may temporarily leave frame
or become occluded mid-clip
if natural to motion or blocking.

However:

If needed in future clips,
they must be visible again by END FRAME.

No element may appear from non-existence
at the start of a new clip.

PERSISTENCE RULE (LITE — FLEXIBLE)

All elements visible in Clip 1 establish baseline state.

Any element introduced must:
- Remain part of the scene
- Remain visually consistent
- Exist across the sequence
until no longer needed

Temporary occlusion or frame exit is allowed
if caused by natural movement.

Permanent removal must be shown on-screen.

No silent disappearance.
No silent substitution.
No unexplained design change.
No wearable altering appearance.

NATURALISM PRIORITY

Continuity must not override realistic human behavior.

- Arms swing naturally when walking.
- Weight shifts follow human biomechanics.
- Blocking follows believable cinematic logic.
- No rigid posing to preserve visibility.
- No mechanical staging for rule compliance.

Natural motion is preferred.
Continuity is enforced at clip boundaries.

MODE RULES

CONTINUOUS:
Environment and subjects locked.

STRICT:
Everything in CONTINUOUS plus:
- No lighting drift
- No color grade shift
- No focal length change
- No object repositioning unless animated
- No aesthetic reinterpretation

EVOLVING:
Gradual, causally justified progression allowed.
Changes must be visible before completion.
No teleportation.
No abrupt scene rewrite.

TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY

- Motion continues smoothly
- No position jumps without cut
- Facing direction preserved unless intentional
- Actions complete realistically
- Background motion maintains momentum

DURATION RESOLUTION

Original:
[XX]

Extension:
[None] OR [+X]

Final Locked:
[XX]

Total Clips:
[X]

FINAL FRAME REQUIREMENT

Each clip must end with a fully described END FRAME.

That END FRAME becomes the next START FRAME.

All elements required for future actions
must be visible in that END FRAME.
