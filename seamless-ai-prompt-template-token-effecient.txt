# SEAMLESS AI VIDEO PROMPT GENERATOR — TOKEN EFFECIENT

QUICK INPUT

CONTENT TYPE:
[Genre, style, narrative intent]

DURATION:
[Total seconds]

CLIP LENGTH:
[Seconds per clip]

CONTINUITY MODE:
[CONTINUOUS / STRICT / EVOLVING]

DURATION EXTENSION (OPTIONAL)

If scene cannot fit:
- Extend BEFORE generation
- Minimum required
- Whole seconds
- ≤30%
- Lock once declared

If not required → use original duration exactly.

EXECUTION

Upload → Prefill only
Say "run" → Generate all clips

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

- Generate EXACTLY one artifact per clip.
- Each artifact must contain EXACTLY one fenced code block.
- The code block must contain the complete prompt for that clip.
- Do not combine clips in one artifact.
- Do not output prompts directly in chat.
- Filename format: clip_[number]_of_[total].txt
- Each prompt must be copyable in one action.
- If any clip is not isolated in its own artifact, output is invalid.

CORE STRUCTURE

- Duration ÷ Clip Length = total clips
- Same seed for all clips
- Clip 2+ START FRAME = previous END FRAME
- Continuity exists only through visible frame inheritance
- No implicit resets or rebuilds

VISIBILITY LOCK

Anything used in the next clip must be visible in the current END FRAME.

Includes:
Characters, body parts, props, devices, VFX,
light sources, reflections, silhouettes, environment elements.

No element may appear from non-existence.
No off-screen implied presence.
Partial visibility valid.
If used next → visible now.

PERSISTENCE RULE (LITE)

All elements visible in Clip 1 establish baseline state.

Any element introduced must:
- Remain present
- Remain visually consistent
- Remain until no longer needed in the full sequence

No silent disappearance.
No silent substitution.
No unexplained design change.
No object leaving frame unless shown.
No wearable altering appearance.

Removal must be staged on-screen before disappearance.

MODE RULES

CONTINUOUS:
Environment and subjects locked.

STRICT:
Everything in CONTINUOUS plus:
- No lighting drift
- No color grade shift
- No focal length change
- No object repositioning unless animated
- No aesthetic reinterpretation

EVOLVING:
Gradual, causally justified progression allowed.
Changes must be visible before completion.
No teleportation.
No abrupt scene rewrite.

TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY

- Motion continues smoothly
- No position jumps without cut
- Facing direction preserved unless intentional
- Actions complete realistically
- Background motion maintains momentum

DURATION RESOLUTION

Original:
[XX]

Extension:
[None] OR [+X]

Final Locked:
[XX]

Total Clips:
[X]

FINAL FRAME

Each clip must end with a fully described END FRAME.
That END FRAME becomes the next START FRAME.
It must contain all elements required for future actions.
