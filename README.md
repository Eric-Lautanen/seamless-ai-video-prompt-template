## 🎬 What Is This?

This is a **professional-grade prompt template** that helps AI models (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc.) generate detailed, frame-perfect video prompts for AI video generators (Runway, Sora, Pika, Kling, Luma Dream Machine, Grok Imagine etc.).

### The Problem It Solves

When you create AI videos by generating multiple clips and stitching them together, you usually get:
- ❌ Jarring camera jumps between clips
- ❌ Subjects teleporting or changing size
- ❌ Lighting that suddenly shifts
- ❌ Motion blur that doesn't match
- ❌ Disconnected storytelling

### The Solution

This template ensures **every single element** continues seamlessly from one clip to the next:
- ✅ Camera position, movement, and speed match perfectly
- ✅ Subject framing stays consistent
- ✅ Lighting and exposure flow naturally
- ✅ Motion blur direction and intensity align
- ✅ VFX elements progress logically
- ✅ The story flows like a single continuous shot

## 🚀 Quick Start (ELI5 - Explain Like I'm 5)

### Step 1: Fill Out the Input Form

At the top of the template file, you'll find a simple form to fill out:

```
CONTENT TYPE(S): [What kind of video? Action? Dialogue? Nature? Sci-fi?]
VIDEO DURATION: [How long? e.g., 60 seconds]
CLIP LENGTH: [Always 6 seconds - this is what AI video generators work best with]
SUBJECT/CONCEPT: [Describe your entire video idea in detail]
STYLE GUIDELINES: [What should it look like? Photorealistic? Anime? Cinematic?]
ASPECT RATIO: [16:9 for YouTube, 2.35:1 for movies, etc.]
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: [Any important moments or effects you want]
```

**Example:**
```
CONTENT TYPE(S): VFX/Fantasy, Environmental/Landscape
VIDEO DURATION: 30
CLIP LENGTH: 6
SUBJECT/CONCEPT: A dragon waking up in a cave, breathing fire
STYLE GUIDELINES: Photorealistic, Game of Thrones style
ASPECT RATIO: 16:9
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: Show the dragon's eye opening first, then pull back to reveal its full size
```

### Step 2: Give It to an AI

Copy the filled-out template and paste it into any AI chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc.) with this simple instruction:

> "Please use this template to generate seamless video prompts for my concept."

### Step 3: Get Your Prompts

The AI will output **detailed prompts for each 6-second clip** that flow perfectly into each other. Each prompt includes:
- Exact camera movements with speeds
- Subject positioning with percentages
- Lighting changes
- Motion blur details
- VFX progression (if applicable)

### Step 4: Generate Your Video

Take each individual clip prompt and paste it into your AI video generator (Runway, Sora, Pika, etc.). When you stitch the clips together, they'll flow seamlessly!
