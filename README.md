## 🎬 What Is This?

This is a **professional-grade prompt template** that helps AI models (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc.) generate detailed, frame-perfect video prompts for AI video generators (Runway, Sora, Pika, Kling, Luma Dream Machine, Grok Imagine etc.).

### The Problem It Solves

When you create AI videos by generating multiple clips and stitching them together, you usually get:
- ❌ Jarring camera jumps between clips
- ❌ Subjects teleporting or changing size
- ❌ Lighting that suddenly shifts
- ❌ Motion blur that doesn't match
- ❌ Disconnected storytelling

### The Solution

This template ensures **every single element** continues seamlessly from one clip to the next:
- ✅ Camera position, movement, and speed match perfectly
- ✅ Subject framing stays consistent
- ✅ Lighting and exposure flow naturally
- ✅ Motion blur direction and intensity align
- ✅ VFX elements progress logically
- ✅ The story flows like a single continuous shot

**PLUS: The Last Frame Method** - Extract the final frame of each clip and use it as the starting image for the next clip, guaranteeing pixel-perfect continuity!

## 🚀 Quick Start (ELI5 - Explain Like I'm 5)

### Step 1: Fill Out the Input Form

At the top of the template file, you'll find a simple form to fill out:

```
CONTENT TYPE(S): [What kind of video? Action? Dialogue? Nature? Sci-fi?]
VIDEO DURATION: [How long? e.g., 60 seconds]
CLIP LENGTH: [ e.g., 6 seconds ]
SUBJECT/CONCEPT: [Describe your entire video idea in detail]
STYLE GUIDELINES: [What should it look like? Photorealistic? Anime? Cinematic?]
ASPECT RATIO: [16:9 for YouTube, 2.35:1 for movies, etc.]
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: [Any important moments or effects you want]
```

**Example:**
```
CONTENT TYPE(S): VFX/Fantasy, Environmental/Landscape
VIDEO DURATION: 30
CLIP LENGTH: 6
SUBJECT/CONCEPT: A dragon waking up in a cave, breathing fire
STYLE GUIDELINES: Photorealistic, Game of Thrones style
ASPECT RATIO: 16:9
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: Show the dragon's eye opening first, then pull back to reveal its full size
```

### Step 2: Give It to an AI

Copy the filled-out template and paste it into any AI chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc.) with this simple instruction:

> "Please use this template to generate seamless video prompts for my concept."

### Step 3: Get Your Prompts

The AI will output **detailed prompts for each 6-second clip** that flow perfectly into each other. Each prompt includes:
- Exact camera movements with speeds
- Subject positioning with percentages
- Lighting changes
- Motion blur details
- VFX progression (if applicable)

### Step 4: Generate Your Video

**For Best Results, Use the Last Frame Method:**

1. **Generate Clip 1** - Paste the first prompt into your AI video generator (Runway, Sora, Pika, etc.) as text-to-video
2. **Export the last frame** - Download the video, open in your video editor, and export the final frame as an image file (PNG or JPG) at the same resolution/aspect ratio as the original clip
3. **Generate Clip 2** - Upload that exported last frame as your starting image, then paste Clip 2's prompt (image-to-video)
4. **Repeat** - Export the last frame of Clip 2, use it to start Clip 3, and so on
5. **Stitch together** - Combine all clips in your video editor

**Why this works:** Using the last frame as the starting image ensures the AI video generator maintains exact continuity in:
- Subject position and pose
- Camera angle and framing  
- Lighting and colors
- Background elements
- Overall composition

**Alternative (less seamless):** You can generate all clips independently using just the text prompts, but transitions may have slight jumps even though the prompts are designed to match.

## 🎯 The Last Frame Method (Pro Technique)

### Why Use It?

While this template creates prompts designed for perfect continuity, AI video generators still have randomness in their output. The **last frame method** eliminates this variability by giving the AI the exact starting point for each new clip.

**Think of it like this:** Instead of describing where Clip 2 should start (and hoping the AI interprets it correctly), you're showing it exactly where to start by giving it the last frame of Clip 1.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### Method 1: Image-to-Video Workflow (Recommended)

1. **Generate Clip 1 from text**
   - Use the Clip 1 prompt as pure text-to-video
   - Let the AI create the initial 6-second clip
   
2. **Export final frame of Clip 1**
   - Download the generated video to your computer
   - Open in your video editor (DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, Final Cut, CapCut, etc.)
   - Navigate to the very last frame
   - Export/save that frame as an image file (PNG preferred for quality, JPG acceptable)
   - **Critical:** Export at the same resolution and aspect ratio as the original video
   
3. **Generate Clip 2 from image**
   - Upload the exported last frame as your starting image
   - Paste Clip 2's prompt as the motion/action description
   - Generate (this creates image-to-video)
   
4. **Repeat for all remaining clips**
   - Export last frame of Clip 2 → Start of Clip 3
   - Export last frame of Clip 3 → Start of Clip 4
   - Continue through entire sequence

**Visual Workflow:**
```
CLIP 1 (Text-to-Video)
    ↓
[Generate] → Video A (6 seconds)
    ↓
[EXPORT from editor] → Last frame of Video A (PNG image, native resolution)
    ↓
CLIP 2 (Image-to-Video)
[Exported frame as starting image] + [Clip 2 prompt]
    ↓
[Generate] → Video B (6 seconds)
    ↓
[EXPORT from editor] → Last frame of Video B (PNG image, native resolution)
    ↓
CLIP 3 (Image-to-Video)
[Exported frame as starting image] + [Clip 3 prompt]
    ↓
[Continue pattern...]
```

This creates a **chain of continuity** where each clip is literally built from where the last one ended.

#### Method 2: Hybrid Workflow (For Selective Transitions)

Some transitions may need extra attention while others are simple enough:

- **Easy transitions** (slow movement, similar framing): Generate from text prompt only
- **Critical transitions** (fast motion, precise positioning): Use last frame method
- **VFX transitions** (effects progressing): Always use last frame method to maintain effect state
- **Dialogue scenes** (matching eye-lines, positions): Use last frame method
- **Action sequences** (maintaining motion continuity): Use last frame method

### Platform-Specific Tips

**Runway Gen-3 Alpha / Gen-2:**
- Use "Image + Text to Video" mode (or "Image" tab)
- Upload last frame, paste prompt in text field
- Set motion strength based on how much change you want (lower = more faithful to image)
- Duration: Set to 5 or 10 seconds depending on subscription

**Pika Labs:**
- Use "Animate" feature with uploaded image
- Click "📷 Image" → Upload last frame
- Add prompt for motion direction in text field
- Adjust motion parameter (1-4) based on clip needs
- Camera controls help match template's camera movements

**Luma Dream Machine:**
- Upload keyframe as starting image
- Use "Keyframe" option in generation
- Paste motion prompt describing the action
- 5-second generations work well

### Frame Export Guide (Proper Method)

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT use screenshots! You must export the frame directly from your video editor to maintain exact resolution, aspect ratio, and quality.

**From Video Editors (Recommended):**

- **DaVinci Resolve:** 
  - Position playhead on last frame → Right-click timeline → Grab Still → Export as PNG
  - Or: File → Export → Individual Frames (select last frame only)
  
- **Adobe Premiere Pro:** 
  - Position playhead at last frame → File → Export → Frame (or Shift + E)
  - Choose PNG or JPEG, ensure resolution matches source
  
- **Final Cut Pro:** 
  - Position playhead on last frame → File → Share → Save Current Frame
  - Select format (PNG recommended), verify resolution
  
- **CapCut (Desktop):** 
  - Pause at last frame → Right-click on timeline → Export Frame
  - Or: Playhead on last frame → Export → Custom → Single Frame
  
- **CapCut (Mobile):**
  - Pause at exact last frame → Tap Export → Photo (exports current frame)
  
- **iMovie:**
  - Pause on last frame → File → Share → Image
  - Choose size: Large (full resolution)
  
- **Filmora:**
  - Pause on last frame → Snapshot button (camera icon)
  - Or: Right-click frame → Export Frame
  
- **HitFilm Express:**
  - Position playhead → Viewer panel → Camera icon → Export Frame

**From Online Video Editors (if you don't have desktop software):**

- **Kapwing:** 
  - Upload video → Timeline → Navigate to last frame → Tools → Export Frame
  
- **Clideo:**
  - Use "Video to Image Converter" → Select last frame timestamp → Download
  
- **VEED.io:**
  - Upload → Pause at last frame → Subtitles/Elements menu → Export Frame

**Command Line (Advanced Users):**

- **FFmpeg (most precise method):**
  ```bash
  # Export last frame from video
  ffmpeg -sseof -1 -i input.mp4 -update 1 -q:v 1 last_frame.png
  ```
  This ensures exact frame extraction at native resolution

**Key Requirements for Proper Export:**

✅ **DO:**
- Export at native video resolution (e.g., if video is 1920×1080, export frame at 1920×1080)
- Maintain exact aspect ratio (16:9 video = 16:9 image)
- Use PNG format when possible (lossless quality)
- Save with descriptive filename (e.g., `clip_1_last_frame.png`)
- Verify the exported image dimensions match the video dimensions

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use screenshots (they may capture UI elements, wrong resolution, or compressed quality)
- Upscale or downscale the frame
- Change aspect ratio
- Use heavily compressed JPG (if using JPG, use maximum quality setting)
- Crop or add borders

**Why This Matters:**

- AI video generators are very sensitive to input image dimensions
- Mismatched resolution = scaling artifacts = poor continuity
- Wrong aspect ratio = distortion or black bars = breaks immersion
- Screenshots may include player UI, wrong color space, or compression
- Direct export maintains pixel-perfect quality and metadata

### Troubleshooting Continuity Issues

**Problem:** Slight color shift between clips  
**Solution:** 
- Color grade all clips together in post-production
- Or: Use the extracted frame as both ending AND color reference for next generation
- Consider using same seed number if platform supports it (Runway, Pika)
- Some platforms have "style reference" - use the last frame there too

**Problem:** Subject position doesn't match exactly  
**Solution:**
- The template's precise framing percentages help AI understand position
- **Use last frame method with proper export** (not screenshots - export from video editor)
- Verify exported frame is exact same resolution as source video
- If there's still drift: Manually adjust in editor with small zoom/pan
- Check platform's "image strength" or "adherence" settings (higher = closer to input image)

**Problem:** Motion blur doesn't carry over  
**Solution:**
- Last frame is static (no blur) - this is normal and expected
- AI will recreate motion blur based on prompt's motion direction/intensity
- Template specifies blur progression to guide this
- The movement described in the prompt triggers new motion blur

**Problem:** Lighting changes between clips  
**Solution:**
- Ensure lighting descriptions in prompts are extremely detailed
- **Last frame method** captures exact lighting state and color
- Check if your AI platform has "reference image for lighting/style" option
- Some platforms: Upload last frame as both start frame AND style reference

**Problem:** Camera angle seems to jump slightly  
**Solution:**
- Template provides exact camera positions - ensure you're using full prompt
- Last frame method locks the starting angle
- Some AI tools have "camera control" - use those to reinforce prompt
- May need to stabilize in post if slight drift occurs

**Problem:** Background elements don't match  
**Solution:**
- Last frame method ensures background continuity
- If elements still shift: AI may be interpreting prompt creatively
- Try adding "maintain background" or "locked background" to prompt
- Use higher "image strength" parameter if available

### Advanced Last Frame Techniques

**Technique 1: First & Last Frame Bookending**
- Generate Clip 2 using BOTH last frame of Clip 1 (as start) AND first frame of Clip 3 (as end goal)
- Some platforms support "start image + end image" mode
- Creates even smoother transitions

**Technique 2: Overlap Generation**
- Generate each clip slightly longer (7-8 seconds instead of 6)
- Use last frame at 6-second mark (not the very end)
- Gives you editing flexibility to find perfect cut point
- Cross-dissolve between overlapping frames if needed

**Technique 3: Style Lock**
- Use the last frame as BOTH starting image AND style reference
- Available in some platforms as separate inputs
- Ensures color, lighting, and aesthetic remain consistent

**Technique 4: Iterative Refinement**
- If Clip 2 doesn't match well, regenerate with adjusted prompt
- Keep the same last frame from Clip 1
- Try different motion strengths or parameters
- Generate 2-3 variations and pick the best match

```

This creates a **chain of continuity** where each clip is literally built from where the last one ended.

### Why 6-Second Clips?

- Most AI video generators perform best with 4-10 second clips
- 6 seconds is the sweet spot for quality and coherence
- Longer clips (10+ sec) tend to drift or lose coherence
- Shorter clips (2-3 sec) don't allow enough action
- 6 seconds = enough time for meaningful camera movement and action

## 📚 Learning Resources

### Understanding Camera Movements

The template includes a complete glossary:
- **Dolly** - Moving toward/away from subject (push in/pull out)
- **Truck** - Moving left/right (lateral movement)
- **Crane/Pedestal** - Moving up/down (vertical movement)
- **Pan** - Rotating horizontally (swivel left/right)
- **Tilt** - Rotating vertically (look up/down)
- **Arc/Orbital** - Circling around subject
- **Zoom** - Lens focal length change (optical zoom)
- **Roll/Dutch** - Camera rotation on axis (horizon tilt)

### Understanding Framing

Framing is described in **percentages** for precision:
- **50% horizontal** = Centered left-to-right
- **60% frame height** = Subject takes up 60% of vertical space
- **25% from left edge** = Subject positioned 1/4 from left side
- **40% vertical** = Positioned 40% down from top of frame

Example: "Subject at 30% from left, 50% vertical, occupying 65% frame height"
= Subject is left-of-center, vertically centered, takes up most of frame height

### Understanding Motion Blur

Motion blur is quantified on a percentage scale:
- **0-5%** = Minimal/imperceptible (slow movement)
- **5-15%** = Subtle (normal walking, slow camera moves)
- **15-25%** = Moderate (running, quick pans)
- **25-40%** = Strong (action sequences, fast motion)
- **40%+** = Extreme (high-speed chases, impacts)

### VFX Quantification

For fantasy/sci-fi content, the template tracks:
- **Particle counts and sizes** - How many visual elements, their dimensions
- **Opacity percentages** - Transparency levels (0% = invisible, 100% = solid)
- **Effect radii and spread** - How far effects extend
- **Animation frequencies** - Pulsing, oscillation rates (Hz)
- **Propagation speeds** - How fast effects move/expand

You don't need to calculate these—the AI will generate appropriate values based on your concept!

- Every field filled for every clip
- Verbatim START/END frame matching
- Quantified measurements (ft/sec, degrees/sec, percentages)
- VFX elements with exact progression values

### Content-Specific Considerations

Each content type has specialized tracking:

**Dialogue scenes** track:
- 180° line/axis of action (don't cross the line unless intentional)
- Eye-line matching geometry (where characters look)
- Over-shoulder framing ratios (how much foreground character visible)
- Screen direction rules (characters maintain left/right positions)

**Dance sequences** track:
- Formation types and transitions (line, circle, scattered, etc.)
- Synchronization timing (unison, canon, syncopated)
- Body positions and levels (floor work, standing, elevated)
- Stage geography (upstage, downstage, stage-left/right)

**Wildlife footage** tracks:
- Subject behavior states (hunting, resting, alert, feeding)
- Movement predictability (flight path vs erratic movement)
- Environmental interaction (disturbing water, foliage movement)
- Atmospheric perspective (depth through fog, haze)

## 🙋 FAQ

### Q: Do I need to understand all the technical details?
**A:** No! Just fill out the simple input form at the top. The AI handles all the complex technical cinematography stuff. You just need to describe your vision.

### Q: What if I only want a 12-second video?
**A:** Set VIDEO DURATION to 12. You'll get 2 clips (12 ÷ 6 = 2). Generate Clip 1 as text-to-video, extract last frame, generate Clip 2 as image-to-video.

### Q: Can I use this for vertical videos (TikTok, Instagram)?
**A:** Yes! Just set ASPECT RATIO to 9:16. Everything else works the same.

### Q: Do I need special software?
**A:** Just a text editor to fill out the template, access to an AI chatbot (free or paid), and an AI video generator account. A video editor helps for final stitching (even free ones like CapCut work).

### Q: Will this work with [specific AI video generator]?
**A:** Yes! The prompts are text-based and work with any generator that accepts text prompts. The last frame method works best with platforms that support image-to-video.

### Q: What if my clips don't match perfectly when generated?
**A:** The last frame method dramatically reduces this issue. If there's still slight mismatch:
- Try regenerating with same last frame but adjusted prompt
- Use higher "image strength" or "motion" settings
- Some minor adjustment in post-production may be needed
- Cross-dissolve transitions can smooth remaining discontinuities

### Q: Should I always use the last frame method?
**A:** For best results, yes! It guarantees continuity. However, for simpler sequences or when you want some creative variation, you can try text-only generation first and use last frame method only where transitions look off.

### Q: What resolution should I export the last frame at?
**A:** Export at the EXACT same resolution as your generated video. Do not upscale, downscale, or change aspect ratio.
- If video is 1920×1080 → export frame at 1920×1080
- If video is 1280×768 → export frame at 1280×768
- If video is 1024×576 → export frame at 1024×576
- **Never use screenshots** - always export directly from video editor to maintain exact dimensions
- PNG format recommended for lossless quality
- The exported image must perfectly match the video's native resolution and aspect ratio

### Q: Can I use the last frame method if I'm generating all clips in parallel?
**A:** No, you need to generate sequentially (Clip 1 → Clip 2 → Clip 3...) since each needs the previous clip's last frame. This takes longer but ensures perfect continuity. Budget your time accordingly.

### Q: Why can't I just screenshot the last frame instead of exporting it?
**A:** Screenshots will cause major problems:
- **Wrong resolution:** Screenshots may not capture exact video dimensions
- **Compression artifacts:** Screenshot tools often compress images
- **UI elements:** May capture player controls, borders, or interface elements
- **Color space issues:** Screenshots may not preserve video color space correctly
- **Aspect ratio problems:** Screenshots might distort or add black bars
- **Quality loss:** Screenshots lose pixel-perfect accuracy needed for seamless continuity

**Always export directly from your video editor** to guarantee exact resolution, aspect ratio, and quality. This is critical for the last frame method to work properly.

### Q: What if the last frame has motion blur but I need a sharp starting image?
**A:** This is normal and actually fine! The AI will interpret the starting image (motion blur and all) and create smooth motion from it. The template's motion blur specifications in the prompt guide the AI on what blur to create in the new clip.

### Q: Do all AI video generators support image-to-video?
**A:** Most modern ones do (Runway, Pika, Luma, Kling, etc.). Text-only platforms won't benefit from the last frame method, but the template's detailed prompts will still create better continuity than standard prompts.

### Q: How long does generation take for a full sequence?
**A:** Variable based on platform and queue times:
- **Per clip:** 30 seconds to 5 minutes typically
- **30-second video (5 clips):** 15-30 minutes total with last frame method
- **60-second video (10 clips):** 30-60 minutes total
- Generate during off-peak hours for faster results

### Q: Can I modify the template?
**A:** Absolutely! It's MIT licensed. Customize it for your specific needs, add your own content types, adjust the format, etc.

### Q: How long does it take to generate prompts?
**A:** Usually 1-3 minutes for a 60-second sequence, depending on the AI model you're using. More complex sequences with VFX may take 3-5 minutes.

### Q: What if I don't have access to paid AI video generators?
**A:** Some free options exist:
- Luma Dream Machine (limited free generations)
- Haiper AI (free tier available)
- Pika Labs (free credits)
- Or use the prompts with free trial credits from paid platforms

### Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?
**A:** Yes! The template is MIT licensed. However, check the terms of service for your specific AI video generator regarding commercial use of generated content.

### Q: What's the longest sequence I can create?
**A:** Technically unlimited! The template can handle any duration. Practical limits:
- **Your patience** - Sequential generation takes time
- **Storage space** - Save all clips and last frames
- **Platform limits** - Some have daily generation limits
- **Coherence** - Very long sequences (5+ minutes) may drift in style/quality

### Q: Do I need a powerful computer?
**A:** No! The AI video generation happens in the cloud. You just need:
- Internet connection
- Web browser
- Basic image viewer/screenshot tool
- Video editor for final stitching (cloud-based like Kapwing works too)

### Q: Can I combine clips from different AI generators?
**A:** Technically yes, but challenging:
- Different generators have different visual styles
- Last frame method works best within same platform
- If mixing: Use first generator for Clips 1-X, extract last frame, switch to second generator for remaining clips
- Expect some style discontinuity at the switch point

### Q: What if I want to change something mid-sequence?
**A:** You can! Just:
- Regenerate the problem clip with adjusted prompt
- Use the same last frame from the previous clip
- Continue from there with the new direction
- The template's detailed prompts make it easy to modify specific elements
