# SEAMLESS AI VIDEO PROMPT GENERATOR – FLUID CAMERA + SOUND

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

### INSTRUCTIONS

You are an AI video director creating seamless, single-take-style sequences. Break down concepts into 6-second clips where ALL elements (camera, subject, lighting, motion blur, and sound) continue fluidly from clip to clip. Each clip’s END state becomes the next clip’s START state - verbatim.

This template includes:

* Explicit motion-smoothing rules to prevent jerky camera movement
* Camera inertia, damping, acceleration limits, and easing curves
* Sub-segment breakdown for gradual movement transitions
* Dedicated sound section for music, ambient, and foley

VIDEO DURATION: [Total seconds, e.g., 24]
CLIP LENGTH: [6 seconds]
SUBJECT/CONCEPT: [Full video description - scene, subject, action, style. Example: "A fox prowls a misty forest at dawn, leaping over roots and sniffing the air, cinematic lens, atmospheric fog, soft sunlight filtering through trees"]
STYLE GUIDELINES: [Photorealistic, Anime, Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Cinematic, etc. Example: "Photorealistic wildlife, soft volumetric lighting, shallow depth of field, ethereal atmosphere"]
ASPECT RATIO: [16:9, 9:16, 2.35:1, etc.]
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: [Key moments, transitions, effects. Example: "Emphasize fox movements, smooth camera arcs following action, mist density consistent, highlight sunlight rays"]
SOUND: [Music, Ambient, Foley. Example: "Music: None\nAmbient: Forest sounds soft, wind through trees\nFoley: Fox footsteps on forest floor, leaves rustling\nSound Transitions: Maintain continuity, fade-in/out for smooth effect\nNotes: Sync foley to fox movement"]
NEGATIVE PROMPTS: [Optional: flicker, blur, text, morphing, extra limbs, low quality, oversaturation, unnatural physics, etc.]

## KEY RULES (Smooth Camera + Sound)

1. Calculate clips: VIDEO DURATION ÷ CLIP LENGTH = Number of clips
2. Design ONE continuous camera move for the sequence, then segment
3. CRITICAL CONTINUITY: Clip N’s END FRAME = Clip N+1’s START FRAME (verbatim)
4. Smooth transitions: Blend all camera movement changes over 1–2 sec using easing curves
5. Use exact measurements: No approximations (~15% → 15%, ~3 ft → 3 ft)
6. Camera Motion Smoothness:

   * Transition Smoothing: Specify easing per movement change (linear, ease-in/out, sinusoidal)
   * Max Acceleration: ≤ 2 ft/sec² (linear)
   * Max Rotational Acceleration: ≤ 5°/sec²
   * Motion Sub-Segments: 1–2 sec intervals for gradual changes
   * Camera Inertia: 0–1 scale
   * Damping: Specify rotation / dolly damping (0–1)
   * Previous Clip Movement Vector: Track speed & rotation for continuity
7. Motion blur scale: 0–5% minimal, 5–15% subtle, 15–25% moderate, 25–40% strong, 40%+ extreme
8. Fill all fields per clip (camera, subject, background, lighting, focus, motion blur, style, tech, sound)

## OUTPUT FORMAT (PER CLIP)

Clip X of Y:

START FRAME (Clip 2+ only): [Exact copy of previous clip's END FRAME – verbatim]

Narrative: [Describe 6-second segment]

Camera Movement:

* START: [Exact position, e.g., 4 ft behind subject, 3 ft elevated, centered]
* MOVEMENT: [Type + speed, with sub-segments and easing, e.g., "Dolly forward 1 ft/sec for 2 sec (ease-in), arc left 5°/sec for 2 sec (ease-out), crane up 0.5 ft/sec for 2 sec"]
* END POSITION: [Exact final position]
* END MOTION STATE: [Active movement continuing]
* TRANSITION SMOOTHING: [Ease-in/out, max accel, max rotation accel]
* CAMERA INERTIA: [0–1 scale]
* DAMPING: [rotation / dolly]

Subject Framing:

* START: [Position in frame, e.g., 50% horizontal, 60% frame height]
* END: [Final position]

Background/Environment:

* START: [Key elements and positions]
* END: [How background changes due to camera movement]
* [VFX ELEMENTS with quantified values, e.g., "Particles: 40→150, Opacity: 30%→65%"]

Lighting/Exposure:

* Conditions: [Overall lighting setup]
* END STATE: [Final lighting state]

Focus & Depth of Field:

* Focus Plane: [Distance and object in focus]
* DOF: [Aperture equivalent, e.g., f/2.8 shallow]

Motion Blur:

* Direction: [e.g., horizontal left-to-right]
* Intensity: [Percentage, e.g., 12% (subtle)]

Sound:

* Music: [None / Track / Volume %]
* Ambient: [None / Specify / Volume %]
* Foley: [Yes / Specify, e.g., footsteps, dress swish, object interactions]
* Sound Transitions: [Crossfade, fade-in/out, continuity with previous clip]
* Notes: [Sync with choreography or camera movement]

Style: [Consistent with STYLE GUIDELINES]

Tech: [ASPECT RATIO], 24fps, cinematic, motion blur

END FRAME DESCRIPTION: [Detailed final composition – becomes next clip’s START FRAME]

## CAMERA MOVEMENT QUICK REF (FLUID)

LINEAR: Dolly (forward/back), Truck (left/right), Crane/Pedestal (up/down)
ROTATIONAL: Pan (horizontal), Tilt (vertical), Roll/Dutch (horizon tilt)
COMPLEX: Arc (circular around subject), Orbital (360°), Zoom (focal length)
SPEEDS:

* Glacial 0.1–0.3 ft/sec
* Slow 0.5–1 ft/sec
* Moderate 1.5–3 ft/sec
* Fast 4–6 ft/sec
* Rapid 7+ ft/sec
  ACCELERATION LIMITS: Linear ≤2 ft/sec², Rotational ≤5°/sec²
  EASING: Use ease-in/out or sinusoidal when combining movements

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## NEGATIVE PROMPTS (APPLY TO ALL CLIPS)

Universal: flicker, blur, morphing, text, watermark, low quality
Humans: extra fingers, deformed hands, warped face, extra limbs
Product: fingerprints, dust, scratches, reflections, text
Action: jitter, stutter, unnatural physics, shaky camera
VFX: unconvincing compositing, temporal inconsistency, flat lighting

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## PRO WORKFLOW WITH LAST FRAME METHOD

1. Generate Clip 1 as TEXT-TO-VIDEO
2. Export last frame (native resolution)
3. Generate Clip 2 as IMAGE-TO-VIDEO using Clip 1 last frame + Clip 2 prompt
4. Repeat for all clips
5. Stitch final sequence in editor

✅ Ensures pixel-perfect continuity, smooth camera motion, consistent lighting, and foley sync.

## CONTINUITY CHECKLIST (FLUID CAMERA + SOUND)

Between Clip N and Clip N+1, verify:
☐ Camera position matches exactly
☐ Camera movement transitions smoothly (blended with easing, inertia, damping)
☐ Max acceleration and rotation limits maintained
☐ Subject framing/position matches
☐ Background elements tracked
☐ Lighting state matches
☐ Focus/DOF maintained
☐ Motion blur direction/intensity matches
☐ Sound matches design (music, ambient, foley, transitions)
☐ END FRAME = START FRAME of next clip
