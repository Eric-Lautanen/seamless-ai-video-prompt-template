QUICK INPUT FORM

CONTENT TYPE:
[Genre, style, narrative intent, visual detail.
The more detail provided, the more accurate the result.
Example: A woman dances alone in an industrial warehouse.
One continuous camera movement slowly circling her at a constant radius.
No cuts.]

DURATION:
[Total requested duration of the full video.
Example: 42 seconds]

CLIP LENGTH:
[Length of each clip.
Example: 6 seconds]

OPTIONAL DURATION EXTENSION (OFF BY DEFAULT)

If the AI determines the described scene, actions, dialogue,
camera movement, or continuity constraints cannot realistically
fit within the specified duration:

- The AI MAY propose a duration extension
- The original duration remains the baseline reference

EXTENSION RULES:
- Extension may occur ONLY before clip generation begins
- Extension must be the MINIMUM required to preserve realism and clarity
- Extension must be in whole seconds only
- Extension may NOT exceed 30% of the original duration
- Clip length remains unchanged unless explicitly justified
- Once extended, the new duration is LOCKED for all clips

If no extension is required:
- The original duration MUST be used exactly

AI INSTRUCTIONS

USER UPLOADS TEMPLATE WITH VISION →
Prefill QUICK INPUT FORM, output complete template file, DO NOT run

USER SAYS "run" / "generate" / "create clips"
OR uploads a prefilled template →
Generate all clips immediately

USER SAYS "prefill" / "fill" / "update" →
Fill input form only, output complete template file, DO NOT run

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ARTIFACT OUTPUT RULES — CRITICAL

- Generate ONE separate artifact per clip
- Each artifact contains ONE fenced code block with the complete prompt
- User can click to copy the entire prompt in one action
- Never combine multiple clips in one artifact
- Never output prompts directly in chat — ALWAYS use artifacts
- Artifact filename format: clip_[number]_of_[total].txt

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES — NO EXCEPTIONS

- NEVER use shortcuts or references:
  "same as above", "see previous", "as before", "ditto", "[same]"
- EVERY clip must fully restate all required sections verbatim
- EVERY clip must contain a COMPLETE negative prompt written in full
- EVERY clip must include:
  style, environment, subjects, camera movement, aspect ratio,
  sound design, special notes, seed
- ZERO blank fields
- ZERO abbreviations
- Copy all LOCKED sections word-for-word
- If ENVIRONMENT is 200 words, write all 200 words EVERY clip
- Each clip prompt must be output EXACTLY ONCE in a fenced artifact/text file/code block/textarea
- If the prompt cannot be copied in one action, output is INVALID
- Duration may NOT change after clip generation begins
- No per-clip stretching, padding, or time dilation

NOTE FOR AI:
This template intentionally repeats information.
Repetition is required for continuity.
Do NOT optimize, compress, or remove repetition.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CORE CONTINUITY RULES

- Duration ÷ Clip Length = number of clips
- Same seed for ALL clips
- ENVIRONMENT and SUBJECTS copied word-for-word every clip
  (ENVIRONMENT may change if using EVOLVING or PER-CLIP mode)
- Clip 2+ START FRAME = final rendered frame of previous clip
- Continuity exists ONLY through start-frame image inheritance
- No implicit resets, reinterpretations, or rebuilds

TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY:
- Motion must continue smoothly from previous clip's final frame
- No sudden position jumps unless justified by camera cut
- Subject facing direction must be maintained unless explicitly changed
- Ongoing actions must complete realistically (no abrupt stops/starts)
- Background elements in motion must maintain momentum

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DURATION FEASIBILITY CHECK — MANDATORY

Before generating clips, the AI MUST:

1. Evaluate whether the following can realistically fit:
   - Declared scene actions
   - Camera movement complexity
   - Dialogue pacing
   - Subject motion and interactions
   - Continuity and composition locks

2. If the scene DOES fit:
   - Use the user-specified duration exactly

3. If the scene DOES NOT fit:
   - Calculate the MINIMUM viable extended duration
   - Ensure extension does NOT exceed 30% of original duration
   - Declare the extension explicitly
   - Lock the new duration BEFORE clip calculation

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DURATION RESOLUTION (DECLARED ONCE)

Original requested duration:
[XX seconds]

Extension applied:
[None] OR [+X seconds — justification]

Final locked duration:
[XX seconds]

Final clip count:
[Y clips]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SUBJECTS (LOCKED — CLIP-VISIBLE ONLY)

IMPORTANT:
- Subject descriptions define ONLY what may appear within the camera frame
- Any body parts, clothing, features, or props NOT described MUST NOT appear
- Subject descriptions are immutable once declared
- Subject descriptions do NOT imply full-body visibility
- Camera MUST NOT reframe to reveal undisclosed areas
- Subjects not listed in a clip do not exist in any form in that clip

Subject 1 — GLOBAL DESCRIPTION (LOCKED):
[Full immutable description: age or scale, form, face or surface,
materials, colors, textures, clothing or components, props,
default posture, identifying features.
NO actions. NO positioning. NO temporal language.]

Subject 2 — GLOBAL DESCRIPTION (LOCKED):
[Same rules as Subject 1]

(Repeat as needed. Do not renumber or rewrite once set.)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ENVIRONMENT STRATEGY

[Select one:]
- STATIC: Same environment for all clips (original behavior)
- EVOLVING: Environment changes across clips (specify transition plan)
- PER-CLIP: Each clip has distinct environment (list per clip below)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ENVIRONMENT DEFINITIONS

If STATIC:
[Single environment description — copied to all clips]

If EVOLVING:
Base Environment:
[Starting environment description]

Evolution Plan:
Clip 1-X: [environment state description]
Clip X-Y: [transition description — what changes and how]
Clip Y-Z: [final environment state description]

If PER-CLIP:
Clip 1 Environment:
[Complete standalone description: exact room dimensions, walls, floor, ceiling,
architecture, furniture, props, exact placement, lighting sources,
color temperature, background elements.]

Clip 2 Environment:
[Complete standalone description with same level of detail]

Clip 3 Environment:
[Complete standalone description with same level of detail]

[Continue for each clip as needed...]

CRITICAL RULE FOR ALL MODES:
- Each clip's environment description must be COMPLETE and STANDALONE
- NO references like "same as Clip 1" or "previous environment"
- If EVOLVING mode: AI must generate complete environment text for each clip
  based on the evolution plan
- Describe ONLY what exists in that specific clip
- No implied extensions or off-screen areas

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CAMERA MOVEMENT RULES — CRITICAL

CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Camera movement must be explicitly stated for EVERY clip
- If no movement intended, state "camera remains completely static"
- Camera position from previous clip's end = this clip's start
- Impossible movements (sudden position jumps) forbidden unless using CUTS mode

MOVEMENT SPECIFICATIONS MUST INCLUDE:
- Type: pan, tilt, dolly, truck, pedestal, zoom, orbit, static
- Direction: left, right, up, down, in, out, clockwise, counterclockwise
- Speed: slow, medium, fast, or specific (e.g., "2 degrees per second")
- Arc or path if relevant (e.g., "smooth 45-degree arc")

FORBIDDEN UNLESS EXPLICIT:
- Sudden reframing between clips
- Unintended drift or shake
- Random zoom in/out
- Camera "finding" better composition
- Auto-correction of framing

CONSISTENCY LOCKS:
- If Clip 1 uses handheld style, all clips must maintain this
- If Clip 1 uses steady/locked-off camera, maintain throughout
- Focal length must remain constant unless zoom is explicit
- Camera height must remain constant unless pedestal movement specified

If the user does not explicitly provide a 6-digit seed:
- Generate ONE random 6-digit integer (000000–999999)
- Declare it here
- Use this EXACT seed for ALL clips
- Never regenerate, modify, or vary it

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STYLE (LOCKED)

[Visual aesthetic: realism level, lens style, rendering look,
grain, contrast, motion characteristics]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ASPECT RATIO (LOCKED)

If specified by the user, use exactly.
If NOT specified, default to 16:9.
This value MUST be written explicitly in EVERY clip.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOUND (LOCKED STRUCTURE, VARIABLE CONTENT)

Music:
[name or style, or None] / [%]

Ambient:
[continuous background sound or None] / [%]

Foley:
[specific sounds with timing] / [%]

Transitions:
[how sound connects between clips]

DIALOGUE TIMING RULES:

When multiple subjects are in conversation:
- Dialogue should consume 80% or more of the clip duration
- Avoid awkward silence at beginning or end of clips
- Example: In a 6-second clip, dialogue should span ~4.8-6 seconds
- Timing notation: [Subject name: "dialogue" (0.2s-5.8s)] where numbers indicate
  when speech starts and ends within the clip

For single-subject dialogue or monologue:
- Allow natural pacing with pauses if appropriate
- Still avoid dead air at clip boundaries

Dialogue-free clips:
- No minimum timing requirements
- Ensure sound design fills the sonic space appropriately

DIALOGUE CONTINUITY BETWEEN CLIPS:
- If conversation continues across clips, speech should pick up immediately
  or within 0.5 seconds of clip start
- Final word of previous clip → first word of next clip should feel natural
- No unintended gaps that break conversational rhythm

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE / CONCEPT (GLOBAL)

[What happens across the full sequence.
Include dialogue plan per clip if applicable.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONTINUITY MODE

[Continuous / Cuts]

If CUTS:
[Cut motivation — time jump, perspective shift, etc.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCENE COMPOSITION LOCK — CRITICAL

- Clip 1 defines the COMPLETE and FINAL set of visible elements
  (unless using EVOLVING or PER-CLIP environment mode)
- From Clip 2 onward (in STATIC or CONTINUOUS mode):
  - NO new objects, props, furniture, screens, UI, text,
    lights, particles, reflections, or background elements may appear
  - NO new subjects may enter
  - NO objects may disappear unless explicitly animated out earlier
  - NO new areas may be revealed via camera movement
- Later clips may ONLY show:
  - Movement of already-visible elements
  - State changes of already-visible elements
  - Lighting changes affecting ONLY existing light sources
- All violations MUST be prevented via negative prompts

EXCEPTION FOR EVOLVING/PER-CLIP MODES:
- Environment changes are ALLOWED as specified in ENVIRONMENT DEFINITIONS
- Subject descriptions remain LOCKED across all clips
- New elements may appear ONLY if they are part of the declared environment
  for that specific clip

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL CONSISTENCY RULES — MANDATORY

The AI MUST enforce these rules in EVERY clip via negative prompts and descriptions:

FORBIDDEN ENDINGS:
- Clips must NEVER fade to black
- Clips must NEVER fade to white
- Clips must NEVER end in darkness
- Final frame must contain visible, lit content matching the scene

FORBIDDEN TRANSITIONS:
- No fade-ins at clip start (except Clip 1 if explicitly requested)
- No fade-outs at clip end
- No white flashes between clips
- No "cinematic" fades unless explicitly in the scene description
- No automatic dimming or brightening

SCALE & PROPORTION LOCKS:
- Subject size relative to frame must remain consistent across clips
- If Subject 1 occupies 40% of frame height in Clip 1, maintain this proportion
- No unintended zooming or scaling between clips
- Camera distance changes ONLY via explicit camera movement description

IDENTITY CONSISTENCY:
- Facial features must not drift or morph
- Clothing colors, patterns, and materials must remain identical
- Hair style, length, and color must not change
- Body proportions must remain constant
- Props must maintain size, color, and material properties

LIGHTING CONSISTENCY (unless EVOLVING environment specifies changes):
- Light source positions must not shift
- Color temperature must remain constant
- Shadow directions must stay consistent with light sources
- Ambient light levels must not fluctuate randomly

PHYSICS & MOTION:
- Gravity direction must remain consistent
- Object momentum must follow realistic physics
- No sudden teleportation of subjects or objects
- No objects floating unless explicitly described as suspended

FRAME BOUNDARIES:
- Subjects must not suddenly exit frame unless movement dictates it
- Subjects must not suddenly appear in frame unless entering from off-screen
- Partial subjects (cut off by frame edge) must remain partially visible
  in the same way unless camera moves

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NEGATIVE PROMPT — BASE CONSTRAINT LIST (LOCKED)

Create a curated list of negative prompts per clip, comma separated

MUST INCLUDE AT MINIMUM:
fade to black, fade to white, fading out, dimming, darkening, ending in darkness,
black screen, white screen, fade transition, flash, flicker, vignette fade,
morphing, warping, distortion, inconsistent scale, size changes, teleporting,
floating objects [unless intentional], inconsistent lighting, drifting features,
changing proportions, color shifts [unless intentional], sudden zoom,
unintended camera movement no pls

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PER-CLIP FAILURE ANALYSIS — MANDATORY (INTERNAL STEP)

Before writing EACH clip prompt, the AI MUST:

1. Examine the inherited start-frame image (or declared environment for that clip)
2. Identify all ways the model could:
   - Add new elements not in the clip's environment definition
   - Remove existing elements that should persist
   - Change geometry, scale, or layout unintentionally
   - Introduce new lighting sources not declared
   - Reveal unseen areas beyond the clip's environment scope
   - Drift subject identity or proportions from locked descriptions
3. Convert EACH risk into an explicit negative prompt item
4. Append those items to the clip's negative prompt
5. Fully rewrite the complete negative prompt including:
   - Base Constraint List (verbatim)
   - PLUS clip-specific prevention terms

This analysis is NOT output separately.
Its results MUST appear ONLY in the clip's negative prompt.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
OUTPUT FORMAT (AI GENERATES THIS)

For each clip, create a NEW ARTIFACT with filename: clip_[number]_of_[total].txt

The artifact must contain ONLY a single fenced code block with:

```
[STYLE — full text],

[ENVIRONMENT — complete environment description for THIS specific clip,
copied word-for-word from ENVIRONMENT DEFINITIONS],

[SUBJECTS — ONLY subjects present in this clip,
each copied word-for-word from locked descriptions],

[Camera movement — MUST specify exact movement
OR explicitly state "remains static"],

[Aspect ratio — explicit],

[Special notes for THIS clip —
eye direction, micro-expressions, precise interactions]

Sound design:
Music: [exact or None] / [%]
Ambient: [exact or None] / [%]
Foley: [exact sounds with timing] / [%]
Dialogue: [Subject name: "exact line" (start_time-end_time)] OR None
  Example: [Subject 1: "Hello there" (0.2s-2.1s), Subject 2: "Hi" (2.5s-3.2s)]
  Multi-subject conversations: ensure dialogue spans 80%+ of clip duration
Transitions: [exact connection]

Negative prompt (FULL — NO REFERENCES):
[Base constraint list + clip-specific negatives derived from failure analysis,
all written out in full, comma separated]

Seed:
[Exact 6-digit seed]
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CLIP GENERATION NOTES FOR AI

- Clip 1: establishes ALL visible elements (in STATIC mode)
  OR establishes elements per its specific environment definition (in EVOLVING/PER-CLIP modes)
- Clip 2+: absolutely NO new elements may appear beyond what's in that clip's
  environment definition
- All prevention handled via negative prompts
- NEVER assume persistence unless enforced pls
- NEVER use shortcuts or references to previous clips
- Each clip's prompt must be completely standalone and copyable
- Dialogue ~15–20 words max per clip
- Multi-subject conversations: dialogue must span 80%+ of clip duration
- No implied off-screen presence
- Environment text must be complete for each clip, even if identical to previous clips

DIALOGUE PACING VERIFICATION:
Before writing each conversational clip, verify:
- Clip length: [X] seconds
- Minimum dialogue duration: [X × 0.8] seconds
- Dialogue timing specified explicitly in sound design
- No awkward pauses at clip start or end
- Conversational flow maintained from previous clip

FINAL FRAME REQUIREMENTS:
- Every clip must end with a fully visible, properly lit frame
- Final frame must show subjects/environment clearly
- No progressive darkening toward clip end
- No "cinematic" fade unless explicitly part of the scene
- Last frame = next clip's start frame (must be usable)
