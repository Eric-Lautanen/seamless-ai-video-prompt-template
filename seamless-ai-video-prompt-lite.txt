# SEAMLESS AI VIDEO PROMPT GENERATOR — LITE / FAST EDITION
# QUICK PROMPTS • CONTINUITY LOCK • CINEMATIC RESULTS

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PURPOSE

This is a streamlined version of the Cinematic Edition.
It prioritizes:
• Speed
• Reliability
• Continuity
• Clean cinematic output

Use this when you want fast, repeatable results without deep camera math.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CORE RULES (READ ONCE)

• Break video into 6-second clips
• AI auto-calculates number of clips: TOTAL DURATION ÷ CLIP LENGTH = NUMBER OF CLIPS
• Use the SAME SEED for every clip (if available)
• CAMERA MOVEMENT LOCK: No camera movement in the first 2 seconds of ANY clip
  - First 2 seconds = camera LOCKED (static hold on START FRAME)
  - Seconds 2-6 = camera movement allowed (slow and smooth only)
  - This creates buttery smooth transitions between clips
• End EVERY clip with the MAIN SUBJECT:
  - Fully visible
  - Centered
  - Unchanged
• Repeat the MAIN SUBJECT DESCRIPTION word-for-word in every clip
• Audio continuity overrides visual continuity
• Avoid random cuts or camera resets
• Each clip prompt must go in its own fenced code block (triple backticks)
so it's one clean copy-paste per clip.

If these rules are followed, continuity holds.

QUICK INPUT FORM

CONTENT TYPE:
[Narrative / Cinematic Dialogue / Action / Documentary / etc.]

VIDEO DURATION:
[X seconds — AI will auto-calculate number of clips]

CLIP LENGTH:
6 seconds

MAIN SUBJECT (LOCKED):
[Single subject description - copy word-for-word in every clip]
OR
N/A — See MULTIPLE SUBJECTS below

MULTIPLE SUBJECTS (LOCKED):
[If multiple subjects, number them and describe each in detail]
1. [Subject One: full physical description, clothing, props]
2. [Subject Two: full physical description, clothing, props]
[Copy these descriptions word-for-word in every clip's END FRAME]

LOCKED SEED (if using):
[6-digit number - use same for all clips]

SOUND SETTINGS:
Music: [Track/style or None] / [%]
Ambient: [Continuous background sounds] / [%]
Foley: [Key sound effects per clip] / [%]
Sound Transitions: [How sound connects between clips]

SCENE / CONCEPT:
[Describe what happens in the full video sequence]

STYLE:
[Visual aesthetic: photorealistic, cinematic, animated, etc.]

ASPECT RATIO:
[16:9 / 2.35:1 / 9:16 / 1:1 / etc.]

SPECIAL NOTES:
[Any critical details about lighting, props, effects, character traits, etc.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CONTINUITY MODE (CHOOSE ONE)

CONTINUITY MODE:
[Continuous / Cuts]

If using cuts:
CUT MOTIVATION:
[Why cuts happen - perspective shift, time jump, emotional beat, etc.]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOUND (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

Music: [Track/style or None]
Ambient: [Continuous environmental sounds]
Foley: [Specific sound effects that anchor reality]
Sound Transitions: [J-cuts, L-cuts, crossfades, hard cuts]

───────────────────────────────
SOUND IN PROMPT RULE (MANDATORY)

In every clip's final prompt, include:
"Sound design: [ambient bed], [specific foley for this clip], [music if any], [dialogue if any]"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NEGATIVE PROMPTS (USE SAME FOR ALL CLIPS)

Starter:
flicker, blur, morphing, text, watermark, low quality

Add as needed:
extra fingers, warped face, jitter, shaky camera, unnatural physics, temporal inconsistency, lens flare, dramatic lighting, colored contacts, makeup glow, CGI sheen, over-saturation, face morph, costume change, hair color shift

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PER-CLIP OUTPUT FORMAT

Clip X of Y:

START FRAME (Clip 2+):
[Exact END FRAME from previous clip]

Narrative:
[What happens in this 6-second clip]

Camera:
[FIRST 2 SECONDS: Static lock on START FRAME]
[SECONDS 2-6: Simple movement if needed — slow push-in, gentle pan, subtle orbit]
[Never: fast movements, whip pans, zooms, shakes in first 2 seconds]

Subject Framing:
[Subject remains centered and fully visible]

Motion:
[Slow / Moderate — smooth and minimal in first 2 seconds]

Sound:
[What continues or changes]

END FRAME DESCRIPTION:
[All subjects numbered exactly as in MULTIPLE SUBJECTS (LOCKED), fully visible, centered or positioned consistently, unchanged in form, lighting, and scale. Repeat their full descriptions word-for-word.]

COMPLETE PROMPT (COPY THIS):
```
[Full positive prompt with all details including: "Camera holds static for first 2 seconds, then [describe movement]"]

Negative prompt: [Full negative prompt]

Seed: [locked seed number]
```

SOUND PROMPT (COPY THIS):
```
Music: [specify track/style or "None"] / [%]
Ambient: [continuous background sounds] / [%]
Foley: [specific sound effects for this clip with timing] / [%]
Dialogue: [exact lines with character names, or "None"]
Sound Transitions: [how sound connects to previous/next clip]
```

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FAST WORKFLOW (LAST FRAME METHOD)

1. Generate Clip 1
2. Export last frame from editor (not screenshot)
3. Generate Clip 2 using that frame
4. Repeat
5. Stitch clips
6. Add or refine sound if needed

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHEN TO USE THIS VERSION

• Social videos
• Ads
• Concept tests
• Shorts
• Rapid iteration
• Client previews
• When tokens are low and you still need 12–30 seconds of usable footage

For full productions, use the Cinematic Edition.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CAMERA MOVEMENT EXAMPLES (CORRECT VS INCORRECT)

❌ INCORRECT (causes jarring transitions):
Clip 2: "Camera immediately pans left following the subject"
Clip 3: "Camera zooms in quickly on the subject's face"

✅ CORRECT (buttery smooth transitions):
Clip 2: "Camera holds static for 2 seconds on START FRAME, then slowly pans left 15° over remaining 4 seconds"
Clip 3: "Camera holds static for 2 seconds maintaining framing, then gentle push-in over final 4 seconds"
